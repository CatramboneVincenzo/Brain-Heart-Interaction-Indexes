# Brain-Heart-Interaction-indexes
The current repository contains an implementation of the Brain-Heart Interaction model proposed by Catrambone et al in 2019 ("Time-Resolved Directional Brainâ€“Heart Interplay Measurement Through Synthetic Data Generation Models").

BHImodel2() is a function that quantify directional Brain-Heart Interplay (BHI) 
adopting the BHI model proposed by Catrambone et al.(2019) [1].

INPUT variables:
- TFR_EEG = Time course of EEG PSD, it must be a matrix: Channels X time points. It should be already filtered in the desired band of interest (psi)
- TFR_HRV = Time course of HRV PSD. It should be already filtered in the desired band of interest. (phi)
- FS      = Sampling Frequency of the two TFRs
- RR      = HRV time series (in seconds)
- win_RR  = windows length (in seconds) in which the RR model is reconstructed (default = 15 secs)
- window  = windows length (in seconds) in which the parameters are calculated (by default, it is assured that: window*FS >= 15 )

OUTPUT variables:
- HeartToBrain = Functional coupling index (c_rrTOeeg(T)) from the given Phi-band of HRV to the given Psi-band of the EEG
- BrainToHF, BrainToLF  = Functional coupling indexes from the given Psi-band of EEG to the LF or HF HRV bands
- HeartToBrain_sigma, HeartToBrain_mc = other parameters that can be extracted from the model in [1]

It is assumed that the signals given as input the BHImodel2() function are artifact free, from algotirhmic and physiological point of view (e.g. ectopic beats, eye blink, movement, ecc.)

To use the software from Matlab or Octave, simply call the BHImodel function in the src/folder. Type 'help BHImodel' from the Matlab/Octave command window for help on the command's syntax and input/output arguments.

The software does not come with a GUI. Assuming 'x' and 'y' being the time course, sampled at 1 Hz, of Power spectral density of an EEG channel in the theta band (4-8 Hz) and HRV series respetively (integrated in LF+HF bands), and 'z' being the original HRV series, the following example performs the BHImodel analysis (with default parameters) and plots the results:

Fs = 1;

[HeartToTheta, ThetaToHF, ThetaToLF] = BHImodel(x,y,Fs,z);

figure, hold all

plot(1:length(HeartToTheta))'/Fs, HeartToTheta); 

plot(1:length(ThetaToHF))'/Fs, ThetaToHF);

plot(1:length(ThetaToHF))'/Fs, ThetaToLF);
