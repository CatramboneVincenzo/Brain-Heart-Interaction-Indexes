# Brain-Heart Interaction Indexes
This code implements the theoretical dissertation about a new Brain-Heart interaction model, published in:
[1] Catrambone Vincenzo, Alberto Greco, Nicola Vanello, Enzo Pasquale Scilingo, and Gaetano Valenza. "Time-Resolved Directional Brain/Heart Interplay Measurement Through Synthetic Data Generation Models." Annals of biomedical engineering 47, no. 6 (2019): 1479-1489.

This function quantifies directional Brain-Heart Interplay (BHI) through the model proposed by Catrambone et al.(2019) [1].

INPUT variables:
- TFR_EEG = Time course of EEG power spectral density (PSD). This must be a matrix (Dimension: Channels X time samples). Each series in each row should be filtered in the desired frequency band of interest (psi)
- TFR_HRV = Time course of HRV PSD (Dimension: 1 X time samples). This should be filtered in the desired frequency band of interest (phi: e.g., LF or HF band).
- FS      = Sampling Frequency of the two TFRs
- RR      = HRV time series (expressed in seconds)
- win_RR  = windows length (expressed in seconds) in which the heartbeat generation model (IPFM) is reconstructed (default = 15 s)
- window  = windows length (in seconds) in which the parameters are calculated (default: window*FS >= 15 )

OUTPUT variables:
- HeartToBrain = Functional coupling index (c_rrTOeeg(T)) from HRV Phi-band to EEG Psi-band
- BrainToHF, BrainToLF  = Functional coupling indices from EEG Psi-band to HRV-LF or HRV-HF bands
- HeartToBrain_sigma, HeartToBrain_mc = model parameters to be used for fitting evaluation [1]

This software assumes that input series are all artifact free, e.g., heartbeat dynamics free of algotirhmic and/or physiological artifacts; e.g. EEG series free of artifacts from eye blink, movement, etc.

To use the software from Matlab or Octave, simply call the BHImodel function in the src/folder. Type 'help BHImodel' from the Matlab/Octave command window for help on the command's syntax and input/output arguments.

The software does not come with a GUI. Assuming the series sampled at 1 Hz, with 'x' as the time-varying PSD of a given EEG channel integrated in the theta band (4-8 Hz)  and 'y' as the time-varying PSD of an HRV series integrated in 0.04-0.4 Hz, and 'z' as the HRV series, the following example performs the BHImodel analysis (with default parameters) and plots the function outcomes:

Fs = 1;

[HeartToTheta, ThetaToHF, ThetaToLF] = BHImodel(x,y,Fs,z);

figure, hold all

plot(1:length(HeartToTheta))'/Fs, HeartToTheta); 

plot(1:length(ThetaToHF))'/Fs, ThetaToHF);

plot(1:length(ThetaToHF))'/Fs, ThetaToLF);
