%% Sinthetic Data Generation model implementation for Brain-Heart Interplay (BHI) time-resolved estimation
% Inputs:  
% EEG: EEGLAB-like structure with the preprocessed EEG signals
% f_lims: a matrix (Nb x 2) identifying the Nb frequency bands limits to be used
% in EEG analysis. Exaxmple: (to use theta, alpha, and beta bands) f_lims = [4 8; 8 12; 12 30];
% RR: HRV series
% RRi: HRV series interpolated
% t_RRi: time vectors corrisponding to RRi samples
% FS_rri: sampling frequency of HRV interpolation (usually 4 Hz)
% FS_bhi: sampling frequency of the output BHI series (usually < 10 Hz)
% TV: time-varying flag. 0 for punctual estimate, 1 for time-resolved estimate.
% file_output: the function automatically saves a 'BHI' variable into the path specified by 'file_output'

% The variable BHI has the following structure:
% BHI.BtH: brain-to-heart estimates, a matrix of (Nb x 2 x Nt_bhi) dimensions
% BHI.HtB: heart-to-brain estimates, a matrix of (2 x Nb x Nt_bhi) dimensions
% BHI.FS_bhi: sampling frequency of the BHI estimates
% BHI.time: time vector of Nt_bhi elements
% BHI.bands: frequency limits of the EEG bands being analyzed
% BHI.parameters.EEG_PSD_wind: time window through which the EEG-PSD STFT has been calculated
% BHI.parameters.EEG_PSD_step: time step through which the EEG-PSD STFT has been calculated
% BHI.channels: EEGLAB-like structure for EEG channels locations
% BHI.events: EEGLAB-like structure for EEG events
%
% 
% This software assumes that input series are all artifact free, e.g., heartbeat dynamics free of algotirhmic and/or physiological artifacts; e.g.
% EEG series free of artifacts from eye blink, movement, etc.

% The software does not come with a GUI. 
% Assuming the series sampled at 1 Hz, with 'x' as the time-varying PSD of a given EEG channel  
% integrated in the theta band (4-8 Hz) and 'y' as the time-varying PSD of an HRV series integrated in 0.04-0.4 Hz,
% and 'z' as the HRV series, the following example performs the BHImodel 
% analysis (with default parameters) and plots the function outcomes:
